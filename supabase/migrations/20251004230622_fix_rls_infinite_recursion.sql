  # Fix RLS Infinite Recursion

  This migration fixes the infinite recursion issue in RLS policies by simplifying
  the policy checks and avoiding self-referencing queries on the profiles table.

  ## Changes
  - Drop all existing policies on profiles table
  - Create new simplified policies that avoid recursion
  - Use auth.jwt() for role checking instead of querying profiles table
