  # Allow employees to take over replacement shifts

  ## Changes
  - Add new policy allowing employees to update shifts marked as seeking_replacement
  - This enables the "Vertretung Ã¼bernehmen" functionality

  ## Security
  - Only authenticated employees can take over shifts
  - Only shifts explicitly marked with seeking_replacement = true can be taken over
  - The employee can change the employee_id to themselves and set seeking_replacement to false
